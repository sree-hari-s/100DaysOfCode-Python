# What is ORM?

ORM is short for Object Relation Mapping (sometimes Object Relationship Mapping).

- Most programming language platforms are object-oriented.
- the data in the RDBMS server is stored in tables.

Object-relational mapping is a technique that maps object parameters to the structure of a layer RDBMS table. The ORM API provides a way to perform CRUD operations without writing raw SQL statements.
