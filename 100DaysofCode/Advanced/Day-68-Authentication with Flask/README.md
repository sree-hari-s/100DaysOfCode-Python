# Authentication Module Documentation

Welcome to the Authentication Module! In this module, we will explore the process of implementing user authentication in a web application. Authentication is crucial for managing user data, securing private information, and controlling access to specific parts of a website.

## Why Authentication?

1. **Associating User Data:** Users generate data on a website (likes, interactions, messages). Authentication allows us to associate this data with individual users, creating a unique identifier for each.

2. **Securing Private Information:** Authentication ensures that private data, such as messages or user-specific content, remains accessible only to the authenticated user.

3. **Access Control:** Websites may need to restrict access to certain areas based on user status (e.g., subscription-based services).

## Getting Started

1. **Structure of the Website:**
   - Homepage with buttons for registration and login.
   - Users, once authenticated, can access the secrets page.

2. **Authentication Methods:**
   - The focus is on creating a secure authentication system.
   - The progression from basic security to industry-standard practices will be covered.

## Project Structure

To simplify the learning process, the website structure is kept minimal. The starting files provided will help you focus on authentication without getting distracted by styling concerns.

## Files Overview

1. **Homepage:**
   - Two buttons leading to the registration and login pages.

2. **Registration Page:**
   - Allows users to sign up with a username and password.

3. **Login Page:**
   - Enables users to log in with their credentials.

4. **Secrets Page:**
   - Accessible only to authenticated users.
