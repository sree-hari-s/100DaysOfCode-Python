"""
Generator Comprehensions are very similar to list comprehensions. One difference between them is that generator comprehensions use circular brackets whereas list comprehensions use square brackets. The major difference between them is that generators donâ€™t allocate memory for the whole list. Instead, they generate each value one by one which is why they are memory efficient.
